🎲 Python Dice Roller

A simple yet visually satisfying Dice Roller program built using Python’s random module and ASCII art!
Roll as many dice as you want and watch them appear side-by-side in clean dice art — just like real ones (but without the gambling part 😏).

✨ Features

🎯 Roll any number of dice (user decides).

🎨 Displays dice using ASCII art (looks awesome in the terminal).

➕ Shows the total sum of all dice rolled.

🧩 Can easily switch between horizontal or vertical layouts.

📜 Code Overview

This program uses:

random.randint(1,6) — to generate random dice values.

A dictionary (dice_art) — that stores visual patterns for dice faces (1 to 6).

Nested loops — to print dice horizontally or vertically.
